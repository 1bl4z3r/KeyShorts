# KeyShorts


KeyShorts is free software to show Keyboard Shortcuts of various well known and relatively unknown actions...

  - It is In ALPHA version
  - It supports Windows shortcuts in an ugly way
  - More work needs to be done

# New Features!

  - Just kidding!!! There are no features


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Please, I am too mature to do all the jobs myself. If you know about any features as well as how to implement it, mail me at [ristikmajumdar@protonmail.com]
